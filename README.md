# @testing-library/react workshop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a workshop for getting to know the testing library and the mocks we use on the frontend.

There is a little serie of exercises where we will make our test files pass with jest.

## How to

Install the modules with `npm i`, then go into the src to see the files from each exercises. Try to do the tests that match the description, then test the files using `npm run test -- <path/to/file>`. If all is green and is matching the description, nice ! You don't need to run the app, just the test on the files.
