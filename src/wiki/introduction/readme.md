# Unit testing workshop

Hello and welcome to this workshop about the frontend unit testing. Here, we will see how get good tests, coverage, and use our mocks within the front productstream.

## The new ways

With the help of the library `@testing-library/react`, we are able to have more control over how we test things, how we understand them and how we're maintaining them. Gone are the inconsistent, very long snapshot that would make a test fail because we changed a class that wouldn't affect the code directly. Now, our tests are user oriented, which means that our test will act and assert as best as an user could.

## Are new tests harder to code ?

While they can be longer, they're not harder by definition. Sure, making a snapshot would take 3 lines but that was very ineffective. Now, we are able to have test that are easy to read, and as such are also rather easy to write too once you get the hang of it. All you need is a bit of initial knowledge that we're going to learn here, and you can be set to do great tests in no time.

## A few exercises to get the rythm

We will see how to develop good practices with this little series of tests that will gradually teach you how to use the tools `@testing-library` has at its disposal. Overall the difficulty level of the workshop is low, it is an introduction and a mind refresh of what we know and how to best use it. If you already know how to develop tests well, you will be familiar with those concepts !

With that in mind, let's begin !
